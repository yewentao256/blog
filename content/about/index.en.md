## Experience

### **SenseTime**

**Deep Learning System Development Engineer**
*Jul 2022 - Aug 2024*

- Developed [LazyLLM](https://github.com/LazyAGI/LazyLLM/issues?q=author%3Ayewentao256+), building a custom **RAG** with a specialized tree architecture that **outperforms Llama Index by 50%** in fetching parent/child nodes, significantly improving query performance.
- Designed and implemented the Op Inferrer for the [DeepLink Framework](https://github.com/DeepLink-org/deeplink.framework/issues?q=author%3Ayewentao256+), bypassing PyTorch's TensorIterator to increase the inference speed of binary, unary, and reduction operators **by 5% across 40+ models**, including large language models (LLMs).
- Implemented multi-chip operator adaptations for [DIOPI](https://github.com/DeepLink-org/DIOPI/issues?q=author%3Ayewentao256+), supporting CUDA, Cambricon, and Ascend architectures.
- Optimized CUDA model performance via DeepLink and DIOPI integration, achieving **a 20% average improvement** across 30+ models, with ResNet50's performance surpassing PyTorch.
- Stabilized **Llama2 70B** training across 64 Ascend 910B chips using ZeRO + TP + PP and mixed-precision training, providing analysis reports and optimizing operator performance, **improving training TGS from 10% to 70% compared to A100 chips**.
- Patented the **One-iter Tool** ([CN117312173A](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN117312173A/en?oq=CN117312173A)), reducing model accuracy validation time from hours to minutes, and integrated it into the CI/CD pipeline, significantly accelerating deployment cycles.

### **SenseTime - R&D Intern**

**Research Institute (Deep Learning Frameworks)**
*Jan 2021 - Jul 2022*

- Developed a training data visualization platform, using FastAPI and Ceph/MySQL/TiDB, deployed in Kubernetes, and integrated with CI/CD pipelines.
- Rebuilt a data collection SDK, increasing data upload efficiency **10Ã—** through parallelism, accelerating model development pipelines.
- Patented a function-level task scheduling tool ([CN115033366A](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN115033366A/en)), simplifying distributed training workflows.
- Led automatic model annotation project across multiple teams, reducing manual labeling costs by **60%**.

### **Wuhan Hongyuan Investment & Creation Technology Services Co., Ltd.**

**Co-founder**
*Nov 2019 - Sep 2020*

- Led software and hardware development for **10+** AI exhibition halls, including one for Henan Shangqiu City Procuratorate, which increased visitor engagement by **50%**. [Example](https://github.com/yewentao256/You-after-taking-drugs)

### **Yuye Tech (Wuhan) Development Co., Ltd.**

**Co-founder** | Wuhan, China  
*Jun 2019 - Nov 2019*

- Led development of a student competition teaming platform, attracting hundreds of users in the first month after launch.
