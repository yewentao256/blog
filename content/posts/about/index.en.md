## 5. Projects

### [PyTorch Contribution](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues?q=author%3Ayewentao256)

- *May 2023 - Present*
- **Identified and optimized the CuDNN Convolution operator** within PyTorch, achieving a 15% performance improvement; this enhancement directly benefits computer vision tasks, improving the training and inference performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs); contribution successfully merged into the PyTorch codebase.
- **Authored a blog series**, "Analyzing PyTorch's Internal Mechanisms," with over 10 [articles](https://wentao.site/categories/pytorch/) published in 2023 and 2024, providing the developer community with insights into PyTorchâ€™s core architecture and optimizations.

### [LazyLLM](https://github.com/LazyAGI/LazyLLM/issues?q=author%3Ayewentao256+)

- *May 2024 - Aug 2024*
- building a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a specialized tree architecture, which improved query performance by 50% over LlamaIndex by enhancing the efficiency of parent/child node retrieval, optimizing response times for large-scale language models.

### [DeepLink](https://github.com/DeepLink-org/deeplink.framework/issues?q=author%3Ayewentao256+)

- *May 2023 - May 2024*
- Designed and implemented the Op Inferrer, bypassing PyTorch's TensorIterator to increase the inference speed of binary, unary, and reduction operators by 5% across 40+ models, including large language models (LLMs).

### [DIOPI](https://github.com/DeepLink-org/DIOPI/issues?q=author%3Ayewentao256+)

- *Apr 2023 - May 2024*
- Implemented multi-chip operator adaptations for DIOPI, supporting CUDA, Cambricon, and Ascend architectures.

### [MicroTorch](https://github.com/yewentao256/MicroTorch)

- *Jun 2023 - Aug 2024*
- Developed a **minimalistic deep learning framework** inspired by PyTorch, implementing core functionalities such as AutoGrad, dynamic computation graphs, and tensor operations.
- Designed to be lightweight and modular, making it ideal for educational purposes, with extensive examples to facilitate learning.

### [CMU CSAPP](https://github.com/yewentao256/CSAPP_15213)
